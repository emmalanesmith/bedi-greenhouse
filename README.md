By Sevita Moiseev, Emma Lane-Smith, Kira Costen, Meeji Koo

The Plant Bed(i) Greenhouse is an automated plant incubator for bringing up houseplants, powered by a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Robot. It eliminates the
challenges of raising a houseplant, particularly for individuals with a busy lifestyle, city-dwellers, and senior citizens.
